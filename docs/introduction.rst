Introduction
==================

There are millions of home automation devices in the world and billions in the
future. Many of these interact with difficulty due to the **absence of a standard**. In this project, we suggest a vision of how we can overcome the problems
of interaction in pear-to-pear way. 

Instead of looking for a **network standard**,
we propose a programming standard through a design pattern. The proposed
pattern design does not travel on data network but code. This feature allows
not only to exceed the limits of data-oriented standards but **to make up for services on the fly**. 

Verification mechanisms that guarantee correctness control the dynamic composition. Finally, an example is presented using the **Lua**
programming language.
