    There are millions of home automation devices in the world and billions in the future. <br>Many of these interact with difficulty due to the absence of a standard. <br>In this project, we suggest a vision of how we can overcome the problems of interaction in pear-to-pear way.

## ðŸ“® Pattern <a name = "tecno"></a>

The design pattern **Share** is made up of three classes:

- Share
- Service
- Feature

**Share** manages the common space for sharing services and services
with **Feature** the implementation of the service.

Each service **must** subscribe to at least one sharing service provider to allow others to use the
service.

## ðŸŽ¯ Description <a name = "desc"></a>

The share pattern is a **metaprogramming pattern** since some parts
of the service are known only at the time of execution and depend on the state
of the system

The definition of a service requires the coding of a function
`function` and its `daemon` resident component, if any. A `pre` predicate specifies the
preconditions for function.

A string attribute identifies service in a unique world. For example an **SNMP MIB** can be
used to identify a service.

.. note::
A management information base **(MIB)** is a database used for managing the
entities in a communication network. Most often associated with the
Simple Network Management Protocol **(SNMP)**, the term is also used more
generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model.

In `function` coding there may be calls to external services that are specified by implementations of
**Feature**. The `id` attribute defines a regular expression that describes semantically the service requested. The invocation of a service within `function`
occurs through the call invocation relating to a specification present in features.

The `call` operation invokes discovery with an id attribute to identify everyone
the services subscribed to **Share** to which the calling service is subscribed. If he comes
produced a non-null set of services, the next phase of invocation of services.

The primitive `get` is used for this phase get code from a service

The use of the pattern can be achieved by defining a **concrete** Share class and **two abstract** classes Service and Feature.

So while the Share class can be created directly, the Share pattern specifies the behavior the pattern requires
basically the implementation of `function`, `daemon`, `pre` and `post` using unchanged the functionality of the
remaining operations related to the structure of the pattern.

In the pattern structure, the subscription to the Share service is not
places no constraints. So you can subscribe to multiple Share or only one.
Another aspect is the interaction between daemon and function. The code associated with function is received by
the get operator **immediately** after executed with daemon.

The interaction between `function` and `daemon` takes place through unforeseen protocols
from the pattern. For example, the protocol can be used as **0MQ**. There
correct interaction between function and daemon **is guaranteed by the fact that both they are developed by the same programmer**.

.. note::
ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library,
aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a **message queue**, but
unlike message-oriented middleware, a **ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker**.

The attach operation is used to register with a `subscriber`. Any positive can be a subscriber however it is plausible that only a few provide
this service. The search for a service is done through a descriptive string.
Could be an ontological descriptor or simply a protocol **MIB** string
SNMP. The match function was used in the specification and the pattern allows the nested call of services
